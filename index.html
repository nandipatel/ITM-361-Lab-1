<h1> Nandi's First Website  </h1>
  <body>
  <p> Hello, my name is Nandi Patel. It's my first year at IIT and my major is ITM.</p>
  <p> I was born in Canada, then moved to Houston, after a couple of years.</p>
  <p> I like to work on jigsaw puzzles and read. My favorite color is blue. </p>
  <p> I like to organize things and make a schedule, even if I don't follow it. It helps me reduce stress. </p>
